# TuitionFee

This program is designed to calculate tuition fees based on the language being learnt and the number of lessons, additional hours and tests that were taken. The language options are Python, Java and C++. 

It will prompt the user to input the language, number of lessons, additional hours and number of tests taken. The program will then compute the fees for each of these as well as the overall tuition fee and then display these fees to the user.

Each language has different minimum amounts of lessons, additional hours, and number of tests - these were provided by the curriculum.
